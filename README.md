Problem Statement:

In today's rapidly advancing healthcare landscape, understanding human anatomy is crucial for both students and professionals in the medical field. Traditional methods of learning anatomy, such as textbooks and static images, often fail to provide an interactive, engaging, and detailed learning experience. Additionally, accessing expert advice for medical inquiries can be challenging due to geographical and financial constraints.
